Non-exceedance probability (NEP) map of LEB
===========================================

This map shows the probability that the predictive distribution of LEB
do not exceeds a pre-defined threshold at each pixel on a 250 by 250
metres regular grid.

-   **Non-exceedance probability (NEP):** Given a specific threshold
    *t*: the values of NEP close to 1 (red) indicate that LEB is almost
    certain to be below *t*; values close to 0 (blue) indicate locations
    whose LEB is almost certain to be above *t*; and locations with
    values around 0.5 are maximally uncertain, in the sense that their
    LEB is equally likely to be above or below *t*.

-   **LEB threshold:** The user can change the threshold, *t*.
